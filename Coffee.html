Coffee and its territory

The coffee plant belongs to the category ‘megaterme’ (plants needing high temperature),
 a shrub that needs a temperature of over 20° for growth.

The most fertile soils for its cultivation lie between theTropic of Cancer and 
the Tropic of Capricorn, areas characterised by a particularly warm climate with frequent rainfall.

The most common types of coffee are Arabica and Robusta: to be able to grow and bear fruit 
the former needs a temperature between 17° and 24°C at a height of 600-800 metres above sea level; 
the latter, on the other hand, 
is cultivated at around 800 metres above sea level and thrives in temperatures between 24° and 30°C.
